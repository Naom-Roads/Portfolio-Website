# Welcome to my portfolio 

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Naomi

Iâ€™m a software engineer and co-founder at [TalkWiz.ai](https://talkwiz.ai), where I build AI-driven tools that automate appointment scheduling and client communication.

ðŸ’¼ Company GitHub: [@naomi-talkwiz](https://github.com/naomi-talkwiz)

ðŸ§  **Past Work:**  
Before founding TalkWiz, I worked at Syncro as a full-stack developer.  
Most of my contributions there were in private repositories under a company GitHub account,  
so they donâ€™t appear in my personal contribution graph.

ðŸš€ **Current Focus:**  
- Building and scaling TalkWiz.aiâ€™s platform  
- Exploring AI integrations in user scheduling and messaging  
- Experimenting with new portfolio and developer experience trends
